As a transplant, I want to know if I know enough about Seattle so that I can pass as a Seattleite.

As a native born Seattleite, I want to know if I can recognize parts of the city so that I can visit places I haven't seen yet.

As a traveler, I want to see obscure parts of Seattle so that I can have a genuine experience.
